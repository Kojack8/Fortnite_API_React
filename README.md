# Fortnite Stat Tracker

## Overview
This is a simple service designed to let players review their statistics in the popular online game, Fortnite. 
All stats are provided by https://fortnite-api.com/

Using the program couldn't be any easier:
1. Enter the name of the Epic ID that you wish to search for.
2. Select the scope of your search, either the current season or all time.
3. Press search. If there's a problem with your query, the relevant  message will be displayed on screen.

Users are able to opt out of stat sharing, therefore, some users stats may not be publically available or incomplete.
